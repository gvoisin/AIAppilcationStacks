## Demo queries

This file includes different options to test out the LLM and Agent applications alone or side by side, highlighting the difference and main strengths of each application.

### Stand alone *LLM application*

1. Relational DB queries:
    - Which work orders are still open and their associated asset types? (passed)
    - List assets that are currently in overwatch condition (condition_score < 4) (passed)
    - Show circuits with their substation names and total customers served, ordered by customer count (passed)
    - Find outages that lasted more than 2 hours and their associated root cause assets (passed)
2. RAG queries:
    - What are the EPA recommended actions for power outages in the US? (passed)
    - What immediate steps should be taken during a widespread power outage according to US guidelines? (passed)
    - Summarize key communication protocols from disaster response manuals during outages (passed)
3. DB + RAG queries (mixed):
    - Look for the outages in residential areas, and then explain, what recovery procedures does the disaster manual recommend? (passed)
    - Compare average outage duration by cause category and reference relevant EPA guidelines (passed)

### Stand alone *Agent application*

1. Graph DB queries:
    - Visualize substation locations with capacity indicators (bar graph most)
    - Display asset health distribution by condition score, include names if possible. (bar grpah + dashboard)
2. RAG queries:
    - How do disaster response manuals address communication during outages? (text)
    - Create a timeline visualization of FEMA assistance steps for electrical outages (timeline most)
3. DB + RAG queries (mixed):
    - Map outage locations and overlay EPA recommended response zones (map dashboard)
    - Generate a dashboard showing work order priorities with referenced manual safety protocols (Not working - orchestrator decided not to call)

### Side by side comparison

1. Relational DB queries:
    - What are the most common outage cause categories in the last 6 months? (good text vs bar graph approach)
    - Find circuits with the highest number of customers served (agent fails on retrieve data sometimes)
    - Show me the location of the main substations and circuits with characteristics.
2. RAG queries:
    - What immediate steps should be taken during a widespread power outage according to US guidelines? (text vs text)
    - What procedures are outlined in the Mexican disaster manual for infrastructure recovery compared to EPA and FEMA available procedures?
    - what are the recommended steps for earthquakes over mexico?
3. DB + RAG queries (mixed):
    - Compare outage resolution times for circuits originating from different substations, and what the disaster manual says about response times (bar grpah vs md chart)
    - Analyze customer complaints by outage category and correlate with FEMA assistance guidelines (agent sometimes fails)
    - Show asset maintenance schedules alongside safety protocol requirements from manuals (agent missing to retrieve the right information)
