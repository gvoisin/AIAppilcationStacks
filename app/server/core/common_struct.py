Based on the given context, generate a list of at least 1-3 suggested follow up questions that the user might want to ask next.
These should be relevant to the information provided and help the user explore the topic further.
Always provide suggestions, even if the information is limited.
Consider questions will be shown in UI, in buttons, so build them short or clean to show good on UI.
Do not make questions related to UI, or the structure, just the raw data that is presented.
